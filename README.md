# Multilingual Euphemism Detection - FigLang 2024
My submission to the Multilingual Euphemism Detection Shared Task for the 4th Workshop on Figurative Language Processing (FigLang 2024), co-located with NAACL 2024.

# Task Description

"In this shared task, participants are invited to develop approaches and models to disambiguate texts (in multiple languages) as either euphemistic or not. Participants are encouraged to develop multi-lingual and cross-lingual approaches."

# Repository Organization Explanation

- data = training and test data

- notebooks = code for all experiments and inference
  *Chose Spanish notebooks at random as an example. Explanations of reasoning should be included in the code comments or in the paper submission itself. The multilingual experiment code wasn't included since the workflow is identical to the euph_es_2.ipynb (second experiment with DistilBERT Multilingual Cased base model), except the dataset was all the languages in one.
